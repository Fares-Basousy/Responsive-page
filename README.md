# landing page project
## notes
1. i added the sect4  and kept reusing it in making different elements to save space
2. i made my own classes in the style.css file for the active elements
3. i toop the nav bar design from https://codepen.io/faresbasousy/pen/poLqQdx
## updates after first review
-  i used the getboundingClientReact instead of the offset and adjusted the sections activty because when the user is browsing the page,a section would be seen as it should activate but it wont because the section hasnt reached the its right spot on the window, so i adjusted it to be more user-end friendly
-  i changed the color scheme of the navigation bar so it would be more **noticeable** 

## updates after first review
- i changed the active section adding and removing to be more dynamic
##### i hope you like it :smile:
